            <h2>Beginning the Game</h2>
            <p>After the board and pieces are correctly setup the next step is begin the game.  Decides who goes
                first by taking one pawn of each color and concealing them in your hands and let the other player
                pick one hand to "pick" their color.  If one or both players wish to use a chess clock, use it!
                It's important to remember that if both players bring a chess set the player with the black pieces
            gets to use their set as long it is not a non standard set.</p>
            <p>After choosing colors it is tradition to shake hands and wish each other good luck.</p>
            <h2>Checkmate and Draw: Ending the game</h2>
            <h3>Checkmate</h3>
            <p>The end of the game comes immediately when one player is placed in check and that player has no way to
            take the checking piece, place a piece of theirs in-between the checking piece and the king or move
                their king to safety.</p>
            <p>In such a case, checkmate has been achieved and the game is over.  While traditionally the player
            delivering checkmate can and should announce "checkmate," it is not mandatory.  The game is over.</p>
            <h3>Draw</h3>
            <p>A draw is when neither side wins and can be the result of several factors: three-fold repetition
            of position, fifty moves without a pawn move, insufficient winning material.  Let's look briefly at
                each.</p>
            <h4>Three-Fold Repetition of Position</h4>
            <p>When a player is about to repeat the position for the third time, the player with the move indicates
            he is about to repeat the position and may claim the draw, normally by placing the piece on the
            square and if playing with a clock, stopping the clock.</p>
            <h4>Fifty Moves: No Pawn Move</h4>
            <p>If a game is played at some point without a pawn move over the past fifty move, the game is a draw.</p>
            <h4>Insufficient Winning Material</h4>
            <p>Examples of insufficient winning material would be: just two kings, a king versus a king and knight, a
            king versus a king and two knights or a king versus a king and one bishop.</p>
            <h4>Draw Offer</h4>
            <p>A draw offer can come from either player but normally it is considered polite to only offer on your
            turn and if playing with a clock, when your clock is running.</p>
