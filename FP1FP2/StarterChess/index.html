            <p>Many people have not learned chess because they've heard it's hard.  They think it's only for the
            super smart.  They think it might not be fun.</p>
            <p>All of these things are absolutely not true.  Check out How to Play in the navigation bar and get
            started in playing one of humanities oldest games.  Chess is one of the oldest known game and is still
            played because it's fun, it's easy to learn but yet it is complex enough to keep many people playing
            their entire lives.</p>
