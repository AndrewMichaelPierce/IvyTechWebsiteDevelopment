            <h2>Castling and en-passant.</h2>
            <h3>Castling</h3>
                <p>Castling is the act of placing the king out of the main play area and into one of the corners
                to keep it safer.  Most pieces are at their most powerful by being in the center of the board. It is
                    this reason we try to tuck it into the corner. Almost all games by experienced players feature this
                    strategy by BOTH players.</p>
            <h3>How to Castle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The king always moves two squares either to the right or the left.</li>
                <li>After the king moves those two squares, immediately place the rook, that is sitting in the corner
                    in the direction the king is moving, on the opposite side of the king in the next most
                adjacent square.</li>
                <li>So in one move, you get to move two pieces at the same time.</li>
                <li>The king can not be in check.</li>
                <li>The king can not cross over a square or land on a square that it would place it in check.</li>
                <li>The rook being used to castle and the king, can not have been moved previously.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>en-passant</h3>
                <p>en-passant is the means by which you can prevent enemy pawns from jumping past your own pawns
                on their initial move if: The enemy pawn jumps forward two squares on it's first move, it then
                stands abreast of your own pawn on the same rank.  en-passant must be used on your first move after
                the enemy pawn makes it's move.  To take the enemy pawn, you must place your pawn on the square behind
                the enemy pawn and remove it from the board.</p>
